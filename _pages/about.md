Hi, I'm Paschal *(pas-kal)*.  
I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at Purdue University's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, currently advised by [Prof Jamie Davis](https://davisjam.github.io/).

My research aims to design novel methods and tools, using techniques from program analysis, formal verification, and runtime defenses, to discover security vulnerabilities in software components.

My work have helped discover 37 vulnerabilities in widely-used embedded software, and have been published at top Software Engineering (ASE 2023, ICSE 2025, ICSE 2026) and Cybersecurity (DSN 2023, USENIX Security 2025) venues.
