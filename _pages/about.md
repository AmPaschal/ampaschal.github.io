Hi, I'm Paschal *(pas-kal)*.  
I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at Purdue University's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, currently advised by [Prof Jamie Davis](https://davisjam.github.io/).

My research focuses on understanding cybersecurity vulnerabilities in embedded systems and designing novel techniques to detect or defend against them.
My work have helped discover 26 vulnerabilities in widely-used embedded software, and have been published at top Software Engineering (ASE 2023, ICSE 2025, ICSE 2026) and Cybersecurity (DSN 2023, USENIX Security 2025) venues.
